To compile the source-code, go to the src directory and type make.

You'll get a file called intrepid-gl.a in the src directory.

This is the one you should link to your project. Don't forget to include libgame.h located in the header directory.

If you have any trouble, check out http://intrepid-gl.sourceforge.net
